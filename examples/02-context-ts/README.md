# Context Example

This example demonstrates how to use `BeaconLog` with a context.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, you must first build the main `beaconlog` library from the project's root directory:

```bash
# From the project root
npm run build
```

This step ensures that the local `beaconlog` dependency used by this example is up-to-date. After building, you can proceed with installing the example's dependencies.

## Running the Example

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the example:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will execute the `index.ts` file, which logs messages with an associated context.
