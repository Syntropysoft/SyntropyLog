## The SyntropyLog Advantage: A Framework for Every Role

<details>
<summary><strong>For the Developer: An Effortless Experience</strong></summary>

> "I just want to get my work done. I need tools that are simple, powerful, and don't get in my way."

-   **Fluent & Agnostic API**: Use a clean, unified API (`.getHttp()`, `.getBroker()`) for all your external communications. Switch from `axios` to `fetch` or from Kafka to RabbitMQ by changing one line in the configuration, not your application code.
-   **Zero Boilerplate**: The `correlationId` is propagated automatically. The logger is context-aware. You just call `logger.info()` and the hard work is done for you.
-   **Rich Testability**: With built-in mocks and spy transports, writing meaningful tests for your instrumentation is trivial, not a chore.
-   **Comprehensive Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with detailed type definitions and IntelliSense support.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For the Tech Lead: Instant, End-to-End Clarity</strong></summary>

> "When something breaks at 2 AM, I need to find the root cause in minutes, not hours. I need to see the whole story."

-   **Automatic Distributed Tracing**: SyntropyLog automatically injects and retrieves a `correlationId` across service boundaries. A single ID connects a user's request from your API gateway, through your services, and across your message queues.
-   **Structured & Actionable Logs**: All logs are JSON-structured for powerful querying. Contextual information (service name, HTTP method, broker topic) is added automatically, turning ambiguous log messages into clear, actionable data.
-   **Robust Pipeline Architecture**: The logging pipeline includes serialization, masking, and context management, ensuring consistent and secure log output across your entire application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["HTTP Request<br/>(X-Correlation-ID: 123)"] --> B(API Gateway);
    B -- "Adds ID to Log" --> C{Log Stream};
    B -- "Forwards ID in Header" --> D[User Service];
    D -- "Adds ID to Log" --> C;
    D -- "Publishes Message with ID" --> E(Kafka Topic);
    E --> F[Dispatch Service];
    F -- "Extracts ID from Message" --> F;
    F -- "Adds ID to Log" --> C;
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For the Manager & DevOps: Ship with Confidence & Control</strong></summary>

> "I need to ensure our systems are secure, compliant, and cost-effective. Surprises are not an option."

-   **Declarative Log Scoping with Logging Matrix**: Stop paying to ingest verbose logs that you don't need. With the `loggingMatrix`, you can declaratively define *exactly* what parts of the context get logged for each severity level. Keep success logs lean and cheap, while capturing the full, rich context when an error occurs.
    ```typescript
    // In your config:
    loggingMatrix: {
      default: ['correlationId'], // Keep it minimal for info, debug, etc.
      error: ['*'],               // Log everything on error.
      fatal: ['*']
    }
    ```
-   **Automated Governance with Doctor CLI**: The `syntropylog doctor` is your automated gatekeeper for CI/CD. It validates configurations *before* deployment, preventing costly mistakes like overly verbose logging in production (saving on ingestion costs) or insecure setups.
-   **Tame Your ORMs with Custom Serializers**: Stop leaking data or polluting logs with massive objects. Define a serializer once for your `Prisma` or `TypeORM` models to ensure that only clean, safe data is ever logged.
-   **Security by Default**: A powerful, zero-dependency masking engine automatically finds and redacts sensitive data like `"password"` or `"creditCardNumber"` at any level of your log objects, ensuring you stay compliant.
-   **Production-Ready Transports**: Multiple transport options including JSON for production tools and human-readable formats for development environments.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

This example shows how to initialize the logger and make an instrumented HTTP request.

```typescript
import { syntropyLog, PrettyConsoleTransport, AxiosAdapter } from 'syntropylog';
import axios from 'axios';

// 1. Configure SyntropyLog once in your application's entry point.
syntropyLog.init({
  logger: {
    level: 'info',
    serviceName: 'my-app',
    transports: [new PrettyConsoleTransport()], // Human-readable for dev
  },
  // Define what context gets logged. Keep it minimal by default, but verbose on error.
  loggingMatrix: {
    default: ['correlationId'],
    error: ['*'], // '*' means log the entire context
    fatal: ['*'],
  },
  context: {
    correlationIdHeader: 'X-Correlation-ID',
  },
  http: {
    instances: [
      {
        instanceName: 'myApi',
        adapter: new AxiosAdapter(axios.create({ baseURL: 'https://api.example.com' })),
      },
    ],
  },
});

// 2. Get the instrumented client and logger anywhere you need them.
const apiClient = syntropyLog.getHttp('myApi');
const logger = syntropyLog.getLogger();

// 3. Use them. The framework handles the rest.
async function main() {
    // Add extra data to the context for this specific operation
    syntropyLog.getContextManager().set('userId', 123);

    logger.info('Fetching user data...'); // Will only have `correlationId` in the context
    
    try {
      await apiClient.request({
        method: 'GET',
        url: '/users/1/posts',
      });
    } catch (err) {
      // This log will contain the full context, including `userId`, because the level is 'error'.
      logger.error({ err }, 'Failed to fetch posts');
    }
}

main();
```
