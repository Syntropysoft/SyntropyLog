To use spy functions like toHaveBeenCalled(), toHaveBeenCalledWith(), etc.
YOU MUST inject your spy function in the constructor:

// For Vitest:
const mockRedis = new BeaconRedisMock(vi.fn);

// For Jest:
const mockRedis = new BeaconRedisMock(jest.fn);

// For Jasmine:
const mockRedis = new BeaconRedisMock(jasmine.createSpy);

// Without spy (basic functionality only):
const mockRedis = new BeaconRedisMock();

DON'T FORGET AGAIN! ðŸ˜¤
